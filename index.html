	<h3> About Han:</h3>
	<p>
	My name is Han Shi. I come from China, and majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems. At first, I thought that I am not a technical guy, so I chose Business Analytics track. However, after taking VBA Programming and Business Programming courses, I found that coding is interesting. Thus, I continued to take courses of Information Systems track. I love music, and I have played the violin for over ten years. In my free time, I like hanging out with my friends and watching movies.
